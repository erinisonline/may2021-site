        May 9, 2021: The Road So Far?
        <p>In my initial project proposal, I planned to focus on typography in three dimensions. I had honestly been more and more interested in typography and type design as I got further along with my college career. This culminated in my desire to simply
            design a normal two dimensional typeface, but my explorations in the Craft department taking Fiber and Jewelry classes pushed me towards more tactile processes. All of this informed my research as I looked towards finding references and people
            whose work I admired. I found Taekyeom Lee / 이태겸’s work a few semesters ago from a Ceramics professor, and so thought this work would be a perfect excuse for me to contact him. I had a lovely chat with him, and my messy notes can be found
            here. </p>
        <p> Velvetyne Type, a free type foundry that I cannot for the life of me remember where I heard about their work, fortunately just released a 3D typeface by Vincent Wagner called Pilowlava 3D. Thinking it might be a long shot, I asked to interview
            him as well. Luckily, he was available through email to do, the text of which can be found here. That interview actually turned me off from my idea at that time which had evolved to me wanting to 3D model a set of 26 letters (either upper
            or lower case) as that would take a lot of learning that I was not… ready to commit to… </p>

        <p> Parallel to my interviews, I was inspired by my Digital Fabrication class (in which I wanted to design myself a flat-pack desk) to check out Serious Play: Design in Midcentury America. I went with my family to the corresponding physical art exhibition
            at the Denver Art Museum in 2019, and it had influenced my view of both children’s toys, design, and play. My Digital Fabrication class worked in tandem with my research for this project, with learning about flat-pack design informing my
