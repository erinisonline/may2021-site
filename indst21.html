        May 9, 2021: The Road So Far?
        <p>
            In my initial project proposal, I planned to focus on typography in three dimensions. I had been more and more interested in typography and type design as I got further along with my college career, and this culminated in my desire to simply design a
            normal two dimensional typeface. My explorations in the Craft department taking Fiber and Jewelry classes, however, pushed me towards more tactile processes. All of this informed my research as I looked towards finding references. I found
            <a href="https://portfolio.taekyeom.com/index.html">Taekyeom Lee / 이태겸’s</a>a work a few semesters ago from a Ceramics professor, and so thought this work would be a perfect excuse for me to contact him. I had a lovely chat with him, and my
            messy notes can be found <a href="taekyeom.html">here.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="http://velvetyne.fr/">Velvetyne Type</a>, a free type foundry, fortuitously released a 3D typeface by <a href="https://vincent.computer">Vincent Wagner</a> called
            <a href="https://velvetyne.fr/news/pilowlava-3d/">Pilowlava 3D</a>. Thinking it might be a long shot, I asked to interview him as well. Luckily, he was available through email to do, the text of which can be found here. That interview turned
            me away from my idea at that time which had evolved to me wanting to 3D model a set of 26 letters (either upper or lower case) as that would take a lot of learning that I was not… ready to commit to… </p>

            Parallel to my interviews, I was inspired by my Digital Fabrication class (in which I wanted to design myself a flat-pack desk) to check out Serious Play: Design in Midcentury America. I went with my family to the corresponding physical art exhibition
            at the Denver Art Museum in 2019, and it had influenced my view of both children’s toys, design, and play. The book inspired my idea of making instead a physical type-inspired toy. My Digital Fabrication research worked in tandem with my research
            for this project, and pushed me to check out Norman Cherner’s How to Build Children’s Toys and Furniture. Both this and the flat-pack influenced my ideas for connecting pieces, such as with hole-and-peg attachment and/or slot-based design.
            Andrew Walsh-Lister, great professor that he is, also armed with a set of initial references, as well as some information about modular type design. I figured modular type design would fit well with my idea of a toy-inspired system of arranging
            and rearranging.

            As time went on, I found myself going back to one artist’s work that I saw in Serious Play: Isamu Noguchi. I had seen a replica of one of his play structures (pictured below) at the Serious Play exhibition, and found myself delighted by its form and utility.
            Looking into his other work, his famous playscapes also struck me in their attention to shape and connection with his landscape architecture work. His work, in my surface-level analysis, straddles the line between geometric and organic form
            and takes calculated advantage of his materials. Besides a general deep dive into his work, I also managed to take advantage of, again, my Digital Fabrication class to use the CNC plasma cutter and cut out Noguchi “inspired” (AKA stolen) shapes.

            I subsequently used the MIG welder to attach these shapes, together, aiming towards spontaneous type-inspired forms. Here’s some pictures:
        </p>
        <p>
            Noguchi has really inspired what I would consider the last phase of the project, which is ideating on the actual shapes to make. Though I didn’t end up mocking them up, which I probably would have done with carboard for some extra thickness. I did one
            mockup that I ended up not liking:
        </p>
        <p>
            This mockup is based on tabs and slots, which were unwieldy to work with even in cardstock form.
        </p>

            As a body of research, I’m planning to continue this work. I had planned to come out of this semester with a succinct product or digital product to release. However, this ability to follow many different lines of inquiry will make my final work stronger—if
            I get to a final product at all.
        </p>
        <p>
            Future explorations will probably include more research into playscapes and Noguchi’s work. I feel conflicted about playscapes because on one hand, open-ended, physical play is important for children. I also think these play structures can be quite beautiful.
            On the other hand, large-scale public works bring up a lot of questions for me about where these places are located, on whose land are they located, and therefore what people may or may not be displaced by such projects historically and now.
