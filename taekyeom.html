    <h3>What are some of the things you’re learning through the process of creating? Do you think your research has answered your questions about the place of typography and the tactility of type in this time in history?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ceramics, kinda, not the others</li>
        <li>Part of teaching philosophy</li>
        <li>Learn how to learn</li>
        <li>Learning how to do typography, use for the whole lifetime in history</li>
        <li>Keep learning how to do</li><br>
        <li>In grad school, take semester off, graphic design major and coming back</li>
        <li>Taking ceramics class, meditation and materials</li>
        <li>Liked it, ceramics in undergrad</li>
        <li>To classmate: retirement plan, starting right now</li>
        <li>Ceramics in thesis project – physicality of type of Cuniform</li>
        <li>Materializing text o Digital type</li>
        <li>In past we had physical type (physical-physical), tangible – tangible vs digital – digital</li>
        <li>Rematerialize</li>
        <li>Clay is finicky, need talent, work w type, clay, design=u nique combo</li>
        <li>Research will contribute to gdes, not many people working with both</li>
        <li>Fiber – embracing talent and interests
    </ul>
    <h3>Why do you choose the materials you choose to create? i.e. ceramics, soap/molds for soap, etc.? Your creations have a lot of variation of form and texture. What inspires the specific forms you create?</li>
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Limitation, originally wanted clean cylinder bc ceramics need to be fired, twisted if more cylindrical</li>
        <li>Details distribute tension throughout the shape</li>
        <li>3d printing, how to print faster, adding nto too much time but also interesting texture</li>
        <li>Not from ceramics, product des, cad=> gradually added in after modular type, learning how to work with firing and 3d type</li>
        <li>Starting w ceramic -> plastic (can work better, more stable)</li>
        <li>Scaffolding, if it works, keep moving on and challenging</li>
        <li>Really like exploration</li>
        <li>making iterations</li>
        <li>Developing printing and clay process, when it started working, keep thinking about it and keep going more </li>
        <li>No one asking, but doing it anyways</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Are there any surprising results you’ve gotten through this process?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Wasn’t really sure if you could do it in the first place, (printing ceramics), lost access to ceramics</li>
        <li>3d printing at home, could do wout casting, purchase first 3D printer</li>
        <li>First printer $466 (cheap version), wasn’t brave enough built as plastic, have to calibrate every time</li>
        <li>Built one, decided to build another one</li>
        <li>If the scaffolding is working, move to the next stage</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Are there differences between communities of designers and communities of makers?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bigger communities – makers</li>
        <li>Woodshop in your garage you’re a maker</li>
        <li>Everyone is a maker</li>
        <li>Makers, also own motivation, play/hobby, not as serious for a job</li>
        <li>Maker may have part as a job, doesn’t start as</li>
        <li>Designers community – professionally, don’t do design for free</li>
        <li>Identity crisis – maker, ceramicists,</li>
        <li>Herbert simon : to design is to devise a course of action aimed at changing current of Interative activity to change the status quo</li>
        <li> Pushing forward towards what you prefer o Act of design can be act of making, depends</li>
        <li>In graphic design – means something specific, but design doesn’t have to be specific</li>
        <li>Vernacular design – doesn’t have to be “professional” but it works o Garage sign – based on what you have, it does its job</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What do you feel is the role of the designer in the objects that you create—are they for open ended play, do you have specific use cases in mind when creating them, etc.?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sometimes yes, sometimes no</li>
        <li>Embosser first – cylinder seal, but has a goal</li>
        <li>Working w clay, figure out you can do something a specific way</li>
        <li>Sometimes feel like you can only see a bit in front of you, so can’t even know what you can do at first</li>
        <li>Exploring what’s possible</li>
        <li>Priting not going well – collapses</li>
        <li>Many times you learn how to work w gravity, collapsed ones have their own beauty</li>
        <li>LOVE – collapsed still resonates of Expressive value of letters, ie. LOVE doesn’t directly relate to the concept o Mess – messy at the bottom -> neat o And materiality</li>
        <li>Holistic experience as education, traditional but also new stuff</li>
        <li>Have to work w customer, but also talk</li>
        <li>Many of times looking for work, but type designer if you focus on the thing you like and are good at, work will find you</li>
        <li>Lecture on ceramics and all, became a part of your practice</li>
        <li>Need to think about marketable skill, but also your work could be marketable at some point</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> inspires the typographic language you employ? How do you choose what typefaces to create with?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Start w play, also some preferences for type</li>
        <li>Prefer humanist/geometric sans, some typefaces work better w digi fab</li>
        <li>Bodoni hard to work with</li>
        <li>Specialized 3D print typeface, know now better which works</li>
        <li>Sometimes like to experiment, i.e. cooper black</li>
        <li>W students, project furniture and typography </li>
        <li>what they did, make a prototype + scale, another version w ¼ plywood + stuff</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How do you approach the role of play in your process? How do you know what you want to continue to explore, and how do you know you’re done exploring?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Not done, but “paused” on explorinig</li>
        <li>Pause it there, might wait until you have an opportunity to bring it to the next level</li>
        <li>Might want to revisit</li>
        <li>Bc teacher, have some freedom not having to do commercial work</li>
        <li>Sometimes its purposeful and sometimes its not, but that’s okay, play for its own sake</li>
        <li>Experience won’t go anywhere, what you’ve learned will stay there</li>
        <li>Some mistakes and exp will all be in your head</li>
        <li>Play itself can be research, can be hard sometimes bc it’s self directed, no one tells you what to do</li>
        <li>Critical play – when you play in a game, it’s your own winning, when you make something there’s no win or lose</li>
        <li>Brain scientists – when you think and synapses talk to each other, multiple times => synapses will be more strongly wired of Insight = > experiences lead to you knowing of Things lead to you learning + problem solving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> do you feel teaching affects graphic design process</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Learn from students i.e. assignment + critique ie. Typography mag</li>
        <li>Learning what your students feel and adjusting projects</li>
        <li>Starting w easy stuff leading to more</li>
        <li>Web + int design w/ coding -> getting better each semester, never making the same mistake</li>
        <li>Educational psych prof = if you cannot articulate what you know to others, you don’t truly know how to do the thing</li>
        <li>Teaching – learning</li>
        <li>Getting in the middle of complex politics, definitely pros and cons between professional + professor, matter of choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Modular type:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Just liked it, thought about it, liking building the system i.e. lego blocks putting together the system -> changes</li>
        <li>Type design is a system and you work with that -> consistency</li>
        <li>Ie. Grid system is sytem</li>
        <li>Created the system + created module</li>
        <li>Hangul – modular system ! hangul => design 3000 at LEAST letters</li>
        <li>Combos w 26 letters</li>
        <li>Core is the system</li>
        <li>Little tiny things accumulate, just like 3d stacks up to build to a bigger thing</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Learn anything about how people used the pieces</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>People are creative and find a crazy way to use it</li>
        <li>Ie. Pencil organizer -> installed and rearrange to write something</li>
        <li>Kids love his work, thought were going to put next to each other but instead stacker o Kid stacking taller than him o Never thought about that! Didn’t mean to but it’s an interesting thing to see</li>
        <li>People find different ways to play with it</li>
        <li>Breaking is good, lego blocks are super creative</li>
    </ul>
